      "refined_text": "In Chapter 1, we introduced various concepts of structure and the idea that the properties of molecules are derived from the combination of the properties of the atoms. One of the qualitative conclusions from these considerations is that the properties of CH3, CH2, CH, and C groups in hydrocarbons are expected to be similar from molecule to molecule, as long as they are not perturbed by a nearby functional group. Several methods for the calculation of thermodynamic data based on summation of group properties have been developed and are discussed in the next two sections. 3.1.2.1. Calculations of Enthalpy of Reaction Based on Summation of Bond Energies. The computation of molecular energy by MO or DFT methods gives the total binding energy of a molecule.",

      "refined_text": "Nucleophilic substitution reactions may involve several different combinations of charged and uncharged species as reactants. The equations in Scheme 4.1 illustrate the four most common charge types. The most common reactants are neutral halides or sulfonates, as illustrated in Parts A and B of the scheme. These compounds can react with either neutral or anionic nucleophiles. When the nucleophile is the solvent, as in Entries 2 and 3, the reaction is called a solvolysis. Reactions with anionic nucleophiles, as in Entries 4 to 6, are used to introduce a variety of substituents such as cyanide and azide. Entries 7 and 10 show reactions that involve sulfonium ions, in which a neutral sulfide is the leaving group.",

      "refined_text": "The ionization and direct displacement mechanisms can be viewed as the limits of a mechanistic continuum. At the SN1 limit, there is no covalent interaction between the reactant and the nucleophile in the TS for cleavage of the bond to the leaving group. At the SN2 limit, the bond-formation to the nucleophile is concerted with the bond- breaking step. In between these two limiting cases lies the borderline area in which the degree of covalent interaction with the nucleophile is intermediate between the two limiting cases. The concept of ion pairs was introduced by Saul Winstein, who proposed that there are two distinct types of ion pairs involved in substitution reactions.",

      "refined_text": "Studies of the stereochemistry are a powerful tool for investigation of nucleophilic substitution reactions. Direct displacement reactions by the SN2(lim) mechanism are expected to result in complete inversion of configuration. The stereochemical outcome of the ionization mechanism is less predictable, because it depends on whether reaction occurs via an ion pair intermediate or through a completely dissociated ion. Borderline mechanisms may also show variable stereochemistry, depending upon the lifetime of the intermediates and the extent of ion pair recombination. Scheme 4.2 presents data on some representative nucleophilic substitution processes.",
